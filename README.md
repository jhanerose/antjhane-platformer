## 📖 Project Overview

**Dream Jumper** is an original, fast-paced endless platformer built entirely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas 2D API. No frameworks. No dependencies. 

Players control a spacefaring ant bouncing upward through an endless, procedurally generated world. Success requires a careful balance of mastering physics-based momentum, navigating six unique platform types, and outrunning a progressive environmental hazard—the Shadow Boss.

Developed as a 14-day sprint for the WebSystems-9318-AY225 Final Project.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Controls

Your ant **bounces automatically** upon landing. Your primary objective is precise horizontal steering to climb as high as possible without falling into the void or being caught by the ascending shadow.

| Action | Primary Key | Secondary Key |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Move Left** | `A` | `←` Left Arrow |
| **Move Right**| `D` | `→` Right Arrow |
| **Pause / Menu**| `Esc` | `P` |

> *Controls can be rebound in the in-game Settings menu.*

## 🪐 Environment & Mechanics

Navigate a procedurally generated vertical obstacle course featuring distinct platform behaviors and dynamic events.

### Platform Types
| Platform | Visual Identity | Behavior & Physics |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Dream** | Purple | Standard bounce; reliable and consistent. |
| **Nightmare** | Red | Crumbles upon landing; zero dwell time. |
| **Glitch** | Amber | Triggers a gravity-warping event on contact. |
| **Moving** | Cyan | Slides horizontally; requires timing prediction. |
| **Spring** | Orange | Instantly launches the player at a 2x height multiplier. |
| **Ice** | Light Blue | Zero friction; momentum carries you sideways. |

### 🌀 The Glitch Event
Landing on an Amber platform triggers a system glitch:
* The canvas fills with a scanline CRT overlay.
* Gravity polarity flips for ~1.8 seconds.
* Particle emitters explode across the screen.

### 👾 The Shadow Boss
A tentacled shadow creature rises from the bottom of the canvas. It scales its vertical acceleration based on your current score. The higher you climb, the more aggressive the pursuit algorithm becomes.

### ⚡ Power-Ups & Items
* ⭐ **Star:** Massive bounce boost (launches far above normal viewport bounds).
* ⚡ **Zap Shield:** Nullifies the next Glitch platform gravity-flip event.
* 🔥 **Boost:** +50% lateral movement speed for 5 seconds.
* 💰 **Coin:** +15 score. Chaining multiple coins without touching a standard platform builds a combo multiplier.

|--------|--------|
| **Vertical Climb** | 10 pts per metre |
| **Coin Collection** | +15 pts |
| **Combo Mechanic** | +5 pts × combo count (requires 3+ consecutive bounces) |
